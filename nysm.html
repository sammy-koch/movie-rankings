    This was a very good movie. I love the visuals and the magic tricks all seem unbelievable until they explain them for you. There are a few parts where it seems a bit supernatural, but I don't think that takes away much from the movie itself. I love the twist at the end of the movie, I truly did not expect it at all. The characters all were well-cast and fit their roles pretty well. Overall a very solid movie but still with room for improvement.
